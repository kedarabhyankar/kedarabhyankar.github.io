My personal website has been brought to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of the different components on the website are done using BootStrap (Created by Twitter)- it allows for easy and responsive reading of the website regardless of the screen size.

Feel free to email me at the emails listed on my page if you have any more questions, or just want to learn more about me as a person!
